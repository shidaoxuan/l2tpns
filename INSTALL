Brief Installation guide for L2TPNS

1. Requirements

  * libcli 1.8.5 or greater
    You can get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcli.

  * A kernel with iptables support.


2. Compile

  * make


3. Install

  * make install.  This process:
    - Installs the binaries into /usr/sbin (l2tpns and nsctl).
    - Creates the config dir /etc/l2tpns installs default config files.
    - Ensures that /dev/net/tun exists.

  * Modify config file.  You probably need to change most of the config
    options.

  * Set up basic firewall rules.  The l2tpns process listens on a bunch of
    ports:

	23/tcp		command line interface
	1701/udp	l2tp (on bind_address)
	1702/udp	control port (nsctl)
	3799/udp	RADIUS DAE port
	32792/udp	clustering messages

  * If you are using the garden plugin, setup the walled garden firewall
    rules.  These should be in /etc/l2tpns/build-garden, which is run by the
    plugin after creating/flushing the "garden" nat table.

	iptables -t nat -A garden -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p tcp -m tcp --dport 110 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.1
	iptables -t nat -A garden -p icmp -j ACCEPT
	iptables -t nat -A garden -j DROP

  * Set up IP address pools in /etc/l2tpns/ip_pool

  * Set up routing.
    - If you are running a single instance, you can simply statically route
      the IP pools to the bind_address (l2tpns will send a gratuitous arp).

    - For a cluster, configure the members as BGP neighbours on your router
      and configure multi-path load-balancing (on Cisco use "maximum-paths").

  * Make l2tpns run on startup.  In a clustered environment running from
    inittab is recomended:

	l2tp:2345:respawn:/home/l2tpns/src/l2tpns >/dev/null 2>&1

  * Test it out.



This software is quite stable and is being used in a production environment at
a quite large ISP.  However, you may have problems setting it up, and if so, I
would appreciate it if you would file useful bug reports on the Source Forge
page:
