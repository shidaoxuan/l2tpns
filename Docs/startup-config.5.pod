=head1 NAME

startup-config - configuration file for l2tpns

=head1 SYNOPSIS

/etc/l2tpns/startup-config

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<startup-config> is the configuration file for B<l2tpns>

The format is plain text, in the same format as accepted by
the configuration mode of l2tpns's telnet administrative 
interface. Comments are indicated by either the character # or !.

=head2 SETTINGS

Settings are specified with

=over

=item B<set> F<variable> F<value>

=back

A list of the possible configuration directives follows. Each of these should be set by a line like:

=over

=item B<set> I<configstring> I<"value">

=item B<set> I<ipaddress> I<192.168.1.1>

=item B<set> I<boolean> I<true>

=back

The following F<variables> may be set:

=over

=item B<accounting_dir> (string)

If set to a directory, then every 5 minutes the current usage for every connected use will be dumped to a file in this directory. Each file dumped begins with a header, where each line is prefixed by #. Following the header is a single line for every connected user, fields separated by a space.

The fields are username, ip, qos, uptxoctets, downrxoctets, origin (optional). The qos field is 1 if a standard user, and 2 if the user is throttled. The origin field is dump if B<account_all_origin> is set to true (origin value: L=LAC data, R=Remote LNS data, P=PPPOE data).

=item B<account_all_origin> (boolean)

If set to true, all origin of the usage is dumped to the accounting file (LAC+Remote LNS+PPPOE)(default false).

=item B<allow_duplicate_users> (boolean)

Allow multiple logins with the same username. If false (the default), any prior session with the same username will be dropped when a new session is established.

=item B<auth_tunnel_change_addr_src> (boolean)

This parameter authorize to change the source IP of the tunnels l2tp. This parameter can be used when the remotes BAS/LAC are l2tpns server configured in cluster mode, but that the interface to remote LNS are not clustered (the tunnel can be coming from different source IP) (default: no).

=item B<bind_address> (ip address)

It's the listen address of the l2tp udp protocol sent and received to LAC. This address is also assigned to the tun interface if no iftun_address is specified. Packets containing user traffic should be routed via this address if given, otherwise the primary address of the machine.

=item B<bind_multi_address> (ip address)

This parameter permit to listen several addresss of the l2tp udp protocol (and set several address to the tun interface).

WHEN this parameter is set, It OVERWRITE the parameters "bind_address" and "iftun_address".

these can be interesting when you want do load-balancing in cluster mode of the uploaded from the LAC. For example you can set a bgp.prepend(MY_AS) for Address1 on LNS1 and a bgp.prepend(MY_AS) for Address2 on LNS2 (see BGP AS-path prepending).

example of use with 2 address:

B<set> I<bind_multi_address> "64.14.13.41, 64.14.13.42"

=item B<cluster_address> (ip address)

Multicast cluster address (default: 239.192.13.13). See the section on Clustering for more information.

=item B<cluster_interface> (string)

Interface for cluster packets (default: eth0).

=item B<cluster_mcast_ttl> (int)

TTL for multicast packets (default: 1).

=item B<cluster_hb_interval> (int)

Interval in tenths of a second between cluster heartbeat/pings.

=item B<cluster_hb_timeout> (int)

Cluster heartbeat timeout in tenths of a second. A new master will be elected when this interval has been passed without seeing a heartbeat from the master.

=item B<cluster_master_min_adv> (int)

Determines the minumum number of up to date slaves required before the master will drop routes (default: 1).

=item B<debug> (int)

Set the level of debugging messages written to the log file. The value should
be between 0 and 5, with 0 being no debugging, and 5 being the highest.
A rough description of the levels is:

=over

=item 0. Critical Errors - Things are probably broken

=item 1. Errors - Things might have gone wrong, but probably will recover

=item 2. Warnings - Just in case you care what is not quite perfect

=item 3. Information - Parameters of control packets

=item 4. Calls - For tracing the execution of the code

=item 5. Packets - Everything, including a hex dump of all packets processed... probably twice

=back

Note that the higher you set the debugging level, the slower the program will run. Also, at level 5 a LOT of information will be logged. This should only ever be used for working out why it doesn't work at all.

=item B<dump_speed> (boolean)

If set to true, then the current bandwidth utilization will be logged every second. Even if this is disabled, you can see this information by running the uptime command on the CLI.

=item B<disable_sending_hello> (boolean)

Disable l2tp sending HELLO message for Apple compatibility. Some OS X implementation of l2tp no manage the L2TP "HELLO message". (default: no).

=item B<echo_timeout> (int)

Time between last packet sent and LCP ECHO generation (default: 10 (seconds)).

=item B<guest_account>

Allow multiple logins matching this specific username.

=item B<icmp_rate> (int)

Maximum number of host unreachable ICMP packets to send per second.

=item B<idle_echo_timeout> (int)

Drop sessions who have not responded within idle_echo_timeout seconds (default: 240 (seconds))

=item B<iftun_address> (ip address)

This parameter is used when you want a tun interface address different from the address of "bind_address" (For use in cases of specific configuration). If no address is given to iftun_address and bind_address, 1.1.1.1 is used.

=item B<l2tp_mtu> (int)

MTU of interface for L2TP traffic (default: 1500). Used to set link MRU and adjust TCP MSS.

=item B<l2tp_secret> (string)

The secret used by l2tpns for authenticating tunnel request. Must be the same as the LAC, or authentication will fail. Only actually be used if the LAC requests authentication.

=item B<lock_pages> (boolean)

=item B<log_file> (string)

This will be where all logging and debugging information is written to.This may be either a filename, such as /var/log/l2tpns, or the string syslog:facility, where facility is any one of the syslog logging facilities, such as local5.

=item B<multi_read_count> (int)

=item B<peer_address> (ip address)

Address to send to clients as the default gateway.

=item B<pid_file> (string)

=item B<primary_dns> (ip address), B<secondary_dns> (ip address)

Whenever a PPP connection is established, DNS servers will be sent to the user, both a primary and a secondary. If either is set to 0.0.0.0, then that one will not be sent.

=item B<primary_radius> (ip address), B<secondary_radius> (ip address)

Sets the RADIUS servers used for both authentication and accounting. If the primary server does not respond, then the secondary RADIUS server will be tried.

Note: in addition to the source IP address and identifier, the RADIUS server must include the source port when detecting duplicates to supress (in order to cope with a large number of sessions comming on-line simultaneously l2tpns uses a set of udp sockets, each with a seperate identifier).

=item B<primary_radius_port> (short), B<secondary_radius_port> (short)

Sets the authentication ports for the primary and secondary RADIUS servers. The accounting port is one more than the authentication port. If no RADIUS ports are given, the authentication port defaults to 1645, and the accounting port to 1646.

=item B<radius_accounting> (boolean)

If set to true, then RADIUS accounting packets will be sent. This means that a B<Start> record will be sent when the session is successfully authenticated, and a B<Stop> record will be sent when the session is closed.

=item B<radius_interim> (int)

If radius_accounting is on, defines the interval between sending of RADIUS interim accounting records (in seconds).

=item B<send_garp> (boolean)

Determines whether or not to send a gratuitous ARP for the bind_address when the server is ready to handle traffic (default: true). This value is ignored if BGP is configured.

=item B<tundevicename> (string)

Named access lists may be defined with either of

=over

=item

B<ip> B<access-list> B<standard> I<name>

=item

B<ip> B<access-list> B<extended> I<name>
